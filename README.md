This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Instruction

1. download npm or yarn
2. download project (extract if archive)
3. npm i or yarn (for download all packages and )
4. npm or yarn start (for start project)

### Text description :

The goal of this exercise is to create a simple web-based JavaScript application that displays information about all the countries in the world.

Requirements:

The application must use the React framework to render its interface. Must be written with Typescript. Must be Hooks or HOC at your discretion.

Use the public API hosted at https://restcountries.eu to retrieve the data you’ll need for this application. The application should access this API during runtime – the data should not be hardcoded or pre-downloaded in any way.

The general structure of the application should be that the initial screen shows the user all of the “regions” that exist in the world, and when they select a region, the application should show a list of all the countries that exist in that region.

The list of countries should be sortable by both the name of the country as well as the population density of the country. The user should be able to sort the list in both ascending and descending directions.

When the user selects a country, they should be presented with an organized, readable display of all the information the API provides for countries.

The interface must be responsive, so that it looks and functions well on both mobile and desktop form factors.

Documentation must be included that instructs a technical person how they can build and execute your application. You can assume they have typical tools like npm, yarn, make, etc.

Advice: Using Create React App to bootstrap and manage the build/execution of your application is absolutely acceptable (and preferred).

Use of modern JavaScript syntax and APIs is encouraged (e.g., classes, arrow functions, destructuring, rest/spread, async/await, promises, etc).

Don’t be afraid to include a test suite for your code.

Deliver your code by either:

Providing a link to a hosted git repository that contains your code (GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket, etc).

Creating a tarball of your code and providing a link where this file can be retrieved.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br />
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.
